FILE-PARSER:
- ability to work with pipes,variable names, and files encountered as arguments

BETTY-COMPLY:

TODO:

un-indentation of 'end' labels (look up the betty docs to be sure that it's only 'end')
remove trailing whitespaces (or test your previous solution)
add a blank line after declarations;
add spaces to the back of commas (if not already included)
remove spaces between function names and open parentheses
unpad parentheses


ALGORITHMS:

switch exception for curly brace indentation:

we do not need to provide an exception for brace indentation . we only need to adjust the branching keywords in a switch statement to act like a closing curly brace when indenting.
and also add the ability to create an indent (i.e work like an opening curly brace by un-indenting while working like a closing curly brace by indenting)


add a blank line after declarations:

type keywords are a pain in the balls, they could be anywhere in any order
but here are the few fail-safe cases where they work for all instances

and if they are not in parentheses.

and they are not (preceded by ^ (and they are followed by a opening curly brace)?)

	if they are on the left side of the equality sign

	regex : \s+((?!\()(extern|volatile|int|float|double|char|short|long long|long double|long|signed|_Bool|bool|enum|unsigned|void|complex|_Complex|size_t|time_t|FILE|fpos_t|va_list|jmp_buf|wchar_t|wint_t|wctype_t|mbstate_t|div_t|ldiv_t|imaxdiv_t|int8_t|int16_t|int_least16_t|int_least32_t|int_least64_t|uint_least8_t|uint_least16_t|uint_least32_t|uint_least64_t|int_fast8_t|int_fast16_t|int_fast32_t|int_fast64_t|intptr_t|uintptr_t)\s*(?!\)))+[[:print:]]*;$

NOTE: this approach won't work for global definitions by default.
	one way to add that would be to use the $` variable to capture keywords that may have occurred before our match (the ones not preceded by a space)

	this approach is solely dependent on no-pad parentheses . e.g (x=5) as opposed to ( x = 5)
	so we need to place this after the unpad_parentheses
